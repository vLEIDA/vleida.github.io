            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">What are KERI, the vLEI, and the LEI?</h2>
            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</h3>
            <p><a href="https://keri.one/" class="underline">KERI</a> is a revolutionary new decentralized public key infrastructure.  Similar to other cryptographic key management infrastructures you might have heard of like TLS/SSL (the "lock icon you see in your browser") or more modern federated identity services like oauth and openid.connect (powering the "log in with google/facebook/apple id" buttons), KERI provides a more modern security layer to enable a decentralized, privacy-preserving, verifiable Internet.</p>
            <p>As a DPKI it provides the classic <i>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)</i> (the real data gets to real people when they need it) triad to data assets as well as more modern features like <i>non-repudiation</i> (bad actors can't make changes) to those assets.  However, it was also designed as an digital identity solution allowing for <i>Identification, Authorization, and Authentication</i> (everyone is identified and only has access to what they are authorized to access).  In the modern world, the data and the identity of those who interact and create the data are becoming ever more intertwined.</p>
            <p>KERI operates in a decentralized manner similar to other identity systems, but unlike those systems it can be scaled down to run on a a mobile phone or all the way up to the scale of enterprise with as many 9's of availability are needed.  Developed at the Trust Over IP Foundation, it truly is the best in class of new Internet identity ecosystems</p>

            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">vLEI, the LEI, and GLEIF</h3>
            <p>Recognizing this, the <a href="https://gleif.org" class="underline">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)</a> picked KERI as its preferred identity solution for its next generation corporate identifier, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei" class="underline">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>.  The vLEI is an extension of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei" class="underline">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> initiative undertaken by the governments of the world in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 to develop an identifier for every entity that does business in International Markets.  The vLEI was imagined as a futuristic cryptographic identifier, rooted in a secure attribution to the entity and the agents of that entity itself, that will be able to provide secure and attributable proof of that identity, communications, auditability, and much more.</p>

            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">But what does it all mean though?</h3>
	    <p>Q: What does it mean though?</p>
	    <p>A: The LEI is basically just a number that can be assigned to any company on Earth that wants one.  These days the LEI is used in financial contracts and trades.  Its really so that countries in the G20 and elsewhere can track who is doing buisiness with whom.</p>
	    <p>Q: Why do we need the vLEI then?</p>
	    <p>A: The vLEI is an extension program of the LEI to bind this number to cryptographic credentials verified and vetted by GLEIF.  GLEIF had the foresight to understand that the world is moving to one that is more people and organization-centric than it has in the past.  An old fashioned identifier like the LEI can be used to validate and verify up to a certain point, but global trade is only accelerating and new modern, secure methods are needed.  Old ways of doing things won't scale to the future and new ways of doing things can bring profit and utility even to very old businesses.  With a set of cryptographic organizational credentials deriving from the controllers of a company itself (its board and officers) and extending throughout the company to its agents, employees, computer systems (maybe even AGI agents in the not too distant future) GLEIF can provide tools to the private sector to make things safer, more efficient, and more trustworthy than ever before across the whole world!</p>
	    <p>Q: Couldn't we do this with older technolgy though?</p>
	    <p>A: The Internet is a case study in attempting to do that for the last 50 years.  Identity has always been focused on computer systems, logins for this system, keys and certificates for other sysytems, communicatino systems that may or may not be tied into all that, very little more than a "signed by" line on document creation and maybe a cryptographic signature whose keys and lineage are unkown.  In the future identity will be focused on businesses themselves and their shareholders or owners, their officers, and their agents and employees.  The old ways of doing things don't work like this, the newer ways like federated identities require a high operating budget or delegating some of your businesses authorities to a third party, and the blockchain crypto world is too onerous and slow to make this vision happen.  Only a technology like KERI can enable the vision of the vLEI to come to life.</p>
