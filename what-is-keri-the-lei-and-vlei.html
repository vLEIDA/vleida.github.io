            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</h3>
            <p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> is a revolutionary new decentralized public key management infrastructure.  Similar to other key management infrastructures like TLS/SSL or more modern federated identity services like oauth and openid.connect, KERI provides the bedrock security layer that a decentralized, privacy-preserving, verifiable Internet needs to operate at the global level.</p>
            <p>As a DPKI it can provide the classic <i>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)</i> triad to data assets as well as more modern features like <i>non-repudiation</i> to those assets.  However, it was also designed as an digital identity solution allowing for <i>Identification, Authorization, and Authentication</i>.  In the modern world, data and the identity of those who interact and create the data are becoming ever closer intertwined.</p>
            <p>Like its federated identity cousins (such as openid.connect) it can operate in a decentralized manner, but unlike those systems it can be scaled down to a single server or a mobile phone or all the way up to the scale of enterprise.  Developed at Trust Over IP Foundation, it truly is the best in class of new Internet identity ecosystems</p>

            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">vLEI, the LEI, and GLEIF</h3>
            <p>Due to all of the above, the <a href="https://gleif.org">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)</a> picked KERI as its preferred identity solution for its next generation identifier, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>.  The vLEI is an extension of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> initiative undertaken by the governments of the world in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 to develop an identifier for every entity on Earth that does business in International Markets.  The vLEI is a cryptographic identifier that will be able to provide secure and attributable proof of that identity as well as so much more. </p>
            <p>The vLEI is envisioned one day to provide an identifier to every company on Earth, that's been vetted by GLEIF, and whose identity can be chained and delegated to agents of those entities.  The future is envisioned that each employee or officer of a company might sign documents, communicate securely, and provide auditable, authorized access to company resources.  All powers and responsibilities delegated through cryptographic identity with a secure root in GLEIF!</p>
