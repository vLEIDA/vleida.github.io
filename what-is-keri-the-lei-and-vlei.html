            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</h3>
            <p><a href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a> is a revolutionary new decentralized public key infrastructure.  Similar to other cryptographic key management infrastructures you might have heard of like TLS/SSL (the "lock icon you see in your browswer") or more modern federated identity services like oauth and openid.connect (powering the "log in with google/facebook/apple id" buttons), KERI provides a more modern security layer to enable a decentralized, privacy-preserving, verifiable Internet.</p>
            <p>As a DPKI it provides the classic <i>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)</i> (the real data gets to real people when they need it) triad to data assets as well as more modern features like <i>non-repudiation</i> (bad actors can't make changes) to those assets.  However, it was also designed as an digital identity solution allowing for <i>Identification, Authorization, and Authentication</i> (everyone is identified and only has access to what they are authorized to access).  In the modern world, the data and the identity of those who interact and create the data are becoming ever more intertwined.</p>
            <p>KERI operates in a decentralized manner similar to other identity systems, but unlike those systems it can be scaled down to run on a a mobile phone or all the way up to the scale of enterprise with as many 9's of availability are needed.  Developed at the Trust Over IP Foundation, it truly is the best in class of new Internet identity ecosystems</p>

            <h3 class="text-1xl font-bold">vLEI, the LEI, and GLEIF</h3>
            <p>Recognizing this, the <a href="https://gleif.org">Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF)</a> picked KERI as its preferred identity solution for its next generation corporate identifier, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>.  The vLEI is an extension of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> initiative undertaken by the governments of the world in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 to develop an identifier for every entity that does business in International Markets.  The vLEI was imagined as a futuristic cryptographic identifier, rooted in a secure attribution to the entity and the agents of that entity itself, that will be able to provide secure and attributable proof of that identity, communications, auditability, and much more.</p>
